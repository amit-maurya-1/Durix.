# Responsive Furniture Website Using HTML CSS & JavaScript

Durix. is a modern, responsive furniture and home decor website designed to showcase premium interior products with a luxurious visual appeal. The project combines elegant typography, interactive UI elements, and a well-structured layout to deliver a smooth and engaging browsing experience for users exploring furniture collections, services, and reviews.







🔶 1. Clean, Modern Design with Luxury Aesthetic
Your color palette (golden-hour, antique brown) combined with elegant fonts (Jost) and soft gradients gives the site a luxurious, high-end interior design feel — perfect for a furniture or decor brand.

🔶 2. Reusable & Modular CSS Architecture
You’ve used utility classes (.flex, .between, .wrapper, .btn, etc.) to keep your CSS clean, organized, and scalable — a great habit for large projects or team collaboration.

🔶 3. Engaging Hover and Scroll Effects
Subtle animations on buttons, icons, and cards (like product hover reveals and rotating icons) create a dynamic and interactive user experience without overwhelming the layout.

🔶 4. Mobile Responsiveness
Your site adapts well to smaller screens using media queries, scaling down typography, hiding non-essential elements (like .bed-detail), and ensuring touch-friendly interaction.

🔶 5. Smart Use of Pseudo-elements & Blur Effects
You've creatively used ::before pseudo-elements and backdrop-filter: blur() to enhance the visual layers, giving depth and a soft-glassmorphism effect — which looks modern and professional.
